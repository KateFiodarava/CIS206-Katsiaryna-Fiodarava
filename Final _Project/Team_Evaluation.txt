Team Evaluation 
Working on this project with my team was honestly a good experience. I think we all got along well and did
our part to make the app come together.

1. What worked well:
We communicated pretty well through the group chat and made sure tasks were divided early on. Everyone showed 
up and contributed, which made things smoother. If someone got stuck, there was always someone else willing to
 help out.

2. What could be improved:
It might’ve helped to have a quick video chat or two just to get on the same page faster. Sometimes we had to 
scroll back through a bunch of messages to figure out where things were left off or who was working on what.

3. My reaction to the experience:
Overall, I liked working in a team. It felt good to have support and share the workload. It also made the 
project feel more real, like how things would go in a job setting. I’d definitely be open to working in 
teams again.

4. Contribution of members:
Everyone pulled their weight and stayed involved. I didn’t feel like anyone was slacking, and we all brought
 something to the table.
